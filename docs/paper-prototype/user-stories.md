1. As a beginner gym goer, I want to find training plans made by others, so I could easily start my training journey.
2. As an athlete, I want to track my rest periods between sets, so I could have a better overview of my training intensity.
3. As a gym enthusiast, I want to see other people's training plans, so I could improve my own.
